# Final Project: Interactive Airbnb Dashboard

## Project Overview

In this final project, we developed an **Interactive Airbnb Dashboard** tailored for Airbnb owners aiming to optimize their property listings and enhance their business strategies. The dashboard offers a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb listings across Five major cities worldwide: Austin, Istanbul, Melbourne, Paris, and Toronto. By utilizing this powerful tool, Airbnb owners can uncover hidden patterns, trends, and insights that are essential for making informed decisions and staying competitive in the dynamic short-term rental market.

## My Contributions

For this project, my contributions were instrumental in elevating the design quality, structure, and interactivity of the dashboard. I was responsible for:

- **Data Integration:** I meticulously gathered and combined all necessary datasets into a single comprehensive main dataset, ensuring consistency and accuracy throughout the analysis.
- **Dashboard Design:** I designed the structure and layout of the dashboard, prioritizing an intuitive and visually appealing interface tailored for Airbnb business owners.
- **Visualization Development:** I created three key visualizations that offer valuable insights into booking trends, occupancy rates, and instant bookable listings. These visualizations include filtering options to enhance functionality and user experience.

Through these efforts, the dashboard became a powerful tool for Airbnb business owners, enabling them to make informed decisions and optimize their property listings effectively.
